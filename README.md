# Ping-Pong (Work in Progress)
Ping Pong IDE Game (Player vs Computer)

## Steps to run this locally:
1. Download the 'src' folder and place it in a folder titled 'PingPong'.
2. Import the PingPong folder as a Java Project into your Java IDE.
3. Run the project as a Java Application.

### Game Instructions:
1. You control the left hand side blue paddle board with the keys 'W' and 'S' on your keyboard.
2. The game ends when you miss the bouncing ball.


### Possible glitches
- If the ball goes behind the player's paddle it may result in an exponential increase of the score recorded due to the game mechanics being based on collision.
